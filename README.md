## Quiz Logic Explanation

Explanations for the quiz logic can be found on our [Quiz Logic Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vg9u90q4_qkNhzvl3R_821J7QjYMaAssX50YsxEbuxs/edit?usp=sharing) and [2022 Research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SP6esbi5cwugqKMzAqEd4ydZVKJx2WZv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106331700266022311408&rtpof=true&sd=true).

## File Structure: 

data/appDevToolRatings.csv is our dataset handed over to us by a previous extern team.

original_java_code is the Java code handed over to us by a previous extern team. This code was semi-functional and not able to intergrate well into a website.

assets/ contain all images used to populate the website.

quiz_logic.js is our JavaScript code to make the quiz functional, display differing results, and send users their results.

index.html is our primary markup document to fill and structure our website.

public/style.css is our primary design document that was based on Figma Prototypes provided by Elo, Gemma, & and Tonai.

[landing.css](landing.css) and [landing.html](landing.html) are the exported prototypes from Figma.

## Built with:
- [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/4.3.3/) - Library with multiple, customizable, built-in charts.
- [chartjs-plugin](https://chartjs-plugin-datalabels.netlify.app/) - Plugin with features to make charts more customizable.

## Recommendations
- Add more app builders (especially web app builders) in data set
- Draw data set from a database or reading from updatable source 
- Account for adding app builders to data set
- Better tie-breaking mechanism
- Flesh out “add-on” platform recommendations 
- Better integration of quiz within website
